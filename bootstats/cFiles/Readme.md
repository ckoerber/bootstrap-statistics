# Infos
This directory contains the `C++` routine which is eventually wrapped by the
`Python` module.
The contents are the `Bootstrapper` class which is used to compute bootstrap 
indices and eventual samples for given input data.

# Install
This folder contains a basic `C++` test file.
To compile the code, you need a `C++` standard `17` compatible compiler.
Once the requirements are fulfilled, `make` to compile the `test` binary.
